    <h1>Components</h1>
    <p>At the heart of this template lie its components, the building blocks that seamlessly integrate to form a cohesive and dynamic user experience. Each component serves a specific purpose, whether it's showcasing luxurious accommodations, facilitating effortless reservations, or engaging guests with captivating visuals and informative content. We have various types of components that range in:</p>
    <ul>
		<li><h2>Header</h2>
			<ul>
				<p>The Header component represents the navigation bar at the top of the website. Here's a breakdown of its structure and functionality:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>State Management:</h3>
						<p>The component uses the useState hook to manage state variables header, openMenu, and isHovered.
							header controls the appearance of the header based on the scroll position.
							openMenu controls the visibility of the mobile menu.
							isHovered tracks whether a dropdown menu item is being hovered over.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Scroll Effect:</h3>
						<p>The component uses the useEffect hook to add an event listener to the window's scroll event.
							When the user scrolls down more than 50 pixels, the header background changes to a solid color with a shadow, creating a sticky header effect.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Header Content:</h3>
						<p>The header contains a logo on the left and a navigation menu on the right.
							The navigation menu consists of links to various pages of the website such as Home, About Us, Rooms, Blog, and Contact.
							The navigation menu is responsive, adapting its layout for desktop and mobile screens.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Dropdown Menus:</h3>
						<p>There are dropdown menus for the Rooms and Blog links in both the desktop and mobile versions.
							On desktop, hovering over these links reveals the dropdown menus.
							On mobile, clicking/tapping on these links reveals the dropdown menus.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Mobile Menu:</h3>
						<p>
							The mobile menu is hidden by default and can be toggled open/close by clicking on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) on the right side of the header.
							When the mobile menu is open, it covers the entire screen and displays navigation links vertically.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Styling and Transitions:</h3>
						<p>The component utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including colors, padding, margins, and flexbox layout.
							Transitions are applied to animate changes in the header background color and the opening/closing of the mobile menu.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Navigation Links:</h3>
						<p>Each navigation link is an anchor (<a>) element with an href attribute pointing to the corresponding page.
							The links change color on hover, providing visual feedback to the user.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Drop down Arrow Icons:</h3>
						<p>There are arrow icons next to the dropdown menu items, indicating that they have sub-menus.
							The icons rotate when the corresponding dropdown menu is opened, providing visual feedback to the user.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
               <p>Overall, the Header component provides users with easy navigation options and adapts its layout for both desktop and mobile devices, enhancing the user experience across different screen sizes.</p>
				<img src="./assets/header.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">
				<p>As can be seen in the above illustratin, the header component contains two sections,one for small devices and one for large devices that is toggled by a menu icon. Customization is easy since you can change the routes to your preferences along with the Logo design when its transparent and when the background has a different color</p>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><h2>HeroSlider</h2>
			<ul>
				<p>To customize the `AOS.init()` function and the `HeroSlider` component, follow these steps:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Customizing AOS.init():</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><span>`duration`</span>:Adjust the duration of animations. Set it to the desired value in milliseconds.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><span>`loop`</span>:Enable or disable looping of animations.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><span>`once`</span>:Determine whether animations should only occur once or every time an element enters the viewport.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><span>`offset`</span>:Set the offset (in pixels) from the top of the viewport at which animations trigger.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><span>`easing`</span>:Enable or disable easing for animations.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Customizing the `HeroSlider` component:</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li><span> Slides Configuration (`slides` array)</span>:
							        - Update the `slides` array with your desired slide content. Each slide object should contain properties like `title`, `bg` (background image), and `btnText`.
								</li>
								<li>
								<span>Parallax Effect</span>:
							     - Adjust the parallax effect settings using the `useParallax` hook. You can modify parameters like `speed` to control the intensity and direction of the parallax effect.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Responsive Behavior</span>:
                                    - Customize the behavior of the slider for different screen sizes using the `isMobile` and `isMidMobile` variables from the `ScreenSizeContext`. Adjust the layout, styling, and behavior accordingly.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Slide Change Handling</span>:
                                    - Implement the `handleSlideChange` function to handle slide change events. This function updates the `activeIndex` state based on the current slide index.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Swiper Configuration</span>:
									- Configure the Swiper component with desired modules (e.g., `EffectFade`, `Autoplay`), effects (e.g., `fade`), autoplay settings, and event handlers (e.g., `onSlideChange`).
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Slide Rendering</span>:
                                    - Map through the `slides` array to render individual slide components. Customize the slide content and styling based on the properties of each slide object.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Conditional Rendering and Styling</span>:
									- Conditionally apply CSS classes or styles based on the active slide index (`activeIndex`). For example, you can scale up the active slide for emphasis.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Button Click Handling</span>:
									Implement functionality for buttons within slides (e.g., booking buttons). Add event handlers to handle button clicks and perform corresponding actions.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</li>
					
                By customizing these aspects, you can tailor the AOS animations and the `HeroSlider` component to fit your specific design and functionality requirements. Remember to test your customizations across different devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and optimized user experience.

		<li><h2>BookForm</h2>
			<p>The `BookForm` component is a form used for booking a room. It consists of input fields for check-in date, check-out date, number of adults, and number of kids, along with a button to submit the form. Here's a summary of its structure and functionality:</p>
             <ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Component Structure</h3>
					<p>- The component renders a `form` element with a specified height and width.
					  - Inside the form, there's a flex container (`div`) with a row layout for organizing input fields and the submit button.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Input Fields</h3>
					<p>- Four input fields are included, each representing a different aspect of the booking:
						- Check-in date: Rendered using the `CheckIn` component.
						- Check-out date: Rendered using the `CheckOut` component.
						- Number of adults: Rendered using the `AdultsDropdown` component.
						- Number of kids: Rendered using the `KidsDropdown` component.
					  - Each input field is wrapped in a `div` with a flexible width (`flex-1`) and a right border to separate them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Submit Button</h3>
					<p> - A submit button is included at the end of the form.
						- The button triggers the `handleClick` function when clicked, which is retrieved from the `RoomContext`.
						- The `handleClick` function is called with the event object (`e`) as an argument, allowing for further processing of the form submission.
					 </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Context Usage</h3>
					<p>- The `handleClick` function is accessed from the `RoomContext` using the `useContext` hook.
					   - This function likely contains logic for handling the form submission, such as validating input data and initiating the booking process.
					 </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Event Handling</h3>
					<p>- The `onClick` event handler is attached to the submit button, triggering the `handleClick` function when clicked.
						- The event object (`e`) is passed to the `handleClick` function, providing access to information about the event, if needed.</p>
				</li>
			 </ul>
			 <img src="./assets/bookform.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">

By organizing the form elements into a cohesive layout and utilizing context for accessing necessary functionality, the `BookForm` component provides a convenient way for users to book a room with specified check-in/out dates and guest counts.
			<p> Its made up of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>AdultsDropdown.jsx component
					<ul>
						The `AdultsDropdown` component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the number of adults for a booking, utilizing context for state management and a dropdown menu for options selection.
						<li><span>Context Usage</span>:- Inside the component, it utilizes the `useContext` hook to access the `adults` state value and the `setAdults` function from the `RoomContext`. This context likely provides information about the number of adults selected for booking.</li>
						<li><span>Dropdown Menu</span>:- The dropdown menu is implemented using the `Menu` component from the 'headlessui/react' library. The `Menu` component wraps both the button trigger and the dropdown items.
							- The button trigger (`Menu.Button`) is styled to display the current selection (number of adults) and an icon (likely a down chevron) indicating that it's a dropdown button.
							- The dropdown items (`Menu.Items`) are rendered as an unordered list (`ul`). Each item (`Menu.Item`) corresponds to a specific selection option (e.g., number of adults). These items are dynamically generated based on the `lis` array, which presumably contains objects with `name` properties representing the number of adults.
						 </li>
						<li><span>Styling</span>:- The dropdown menu and its items are styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes to control their appearance, such as background color, border, hover effects, and spacing.</li>

					</ul>
					<img src="./assets/adultsDrop.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">
				</li>
				<li>KidsDropdown.jsx component
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to AdultsDropdown but for selecting kids for a booking, utilizing context for state management and a dropdown menu for options selection.</li>
					</ul>
					
				</li>
				<li>CheckIn.jsx component
					<ul>
						The CheckIn component is a date picker component that allows users to select a check-in date for booking purposes. Here's a summary of its structure and functionality:
                
						<li><span>State Management:</span>Inside the component, it utilizes the useState hook to manage the state of the selected check-in date (startDate). Initially, the state is set to false.</li>
						<li><span>Date Picker Integration</span>
							The component integrates a date picker functionality using an external library, likely react-datepicker.
							The DatePicker component is rendered within the component's JSX, allowing users to select a date from a calendar interface.
							The selected prop of the DatePicker component is bound to the startDate state, indicating the currently selected check-in date.
							The onChange prop of the DatePicker component is assigned a function that updates the startDate state whenever a new date is selected by the user.</li>
						<li>
							<span>Icon Display</span>
							An icon representing a calendar is displayed alongside the date picker input field. This icon serves as a visual cue to users that the input field is for selecting a date.
                            The icon is positioned using absolute positioning (absolute) within a parent container (relative). This ensures proper alignment of the icon within the input field.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>
							 Styling
							</span>
							The component utilizes Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling, including flex for flexbox layout, items-center for vertical alignment, justify-end for alignment to the end of the container, and others for responsive design (md:hidden, lg:block).
						</li>

					</ul>
					<img src="./assets/checkin.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">
					Overall, the CheckIn component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a check-in date, enhancing the booking experience for users.
				</li>
				<li>CheckOut.jsx component
					<ul>
						<li>The CheckOut component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a check-out date, enhancing the booking experience for users.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Requires little to no customization if the theme is customized.Its also ready for any further functinality that may require the backend</p>
		</li>
		<li><h2>Breaker</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<img src="./assets/breaker.png" alt="" width="100%" height="auto">
					<p>This is a component serves as a flexible element that can be used to add spacing or visual breaks between other elements in a React application's UI. Its height can be adjusted by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes applied to it, providing developers with a convenient way to control its appearance.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<h2>ArrowUp</h2>
			<p>
				The `ArrowUp` component renders a button that appears at the bottom-right corner of the screen when the user scrolls down, allowing them to quickly scroll back to the top of the page. Here's a summary of its structure and functionality:


By providing users with a convenient way to return to the top of the page, the `ArrowUp` component enhances the user experience, especially on pages with lengthy content.
			</p>
			<ul>
              <li>
				<h3>State Management</h3>
				<p>The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `header` state, which determines whether the button should be displayed based on the user's scroll position.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <h3>Effect for Scroll Event</h3>
				<p>- The `useEffect` hook is used to add a scroll event listener to the window.
					- When the user scrolls, the event listener updates the `header` state based on the scroll position. If the scroll position is greater than 50 pixels, `header` is set to `true`; otherwise, it's set to `false`.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
			      <h3>Rendering Logic</h3>
			    	<p>
					- The component conditionally renders the button based on the value of the `header` state.
					- If `header` is `true`, indicating that the user has scrolled down, the button is rendered.
					- If `header` is `false`, indicating that the user is at the top of the page, an empty fragment is rendered.
				  </p>
				</li>
			    <li>
					<h3>Button Behavior</h3>
					<p>- When the button is clicked (`onClick` event), the `window.scrollTo` function is called to scroll back to the top of the page (coordinates `{0, 0}`).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Styling and Positioning</h3>
					<p>- The button is styled and positioned using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
						- It's fixed to the bottom-right corner of the screen (`fixed bottom-8 right-8`).
						- The `z-50` class ensures that the button appears above other content on the page.</p>
				</li>
				
			 </li>
			 <li>
				<h2>Others</h2>
				 <p>Other components majorly require change in theme, content, and images which can be done as depicted in their respective menus</p>
